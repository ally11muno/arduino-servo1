 - **** : These marks mean they are servos' center potition and have to calibrated (your robot legs' potitioning when it's idle).
  - ***  : These marks mean arduino pins asignment (sensors & servos connection to arduino). Refer to this when you build the robot.
  - **   : These marks mean that the values optionally can be changed according to your taste (legs' step width, how much to turn when sensing light/obstacle, etc). Just leave it as is if you don't know what you were doing.
-tested on Arduino Pro Mini (5v, 16MHz) and Uno
